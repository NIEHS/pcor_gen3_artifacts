Except when they are the first or last words of the title or heading.

In the title, headings, and subheadings, the following should be capitalized:

Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs
Subordinate conjunctions (As, That, Because, Although, Until, If, etc.)
Verbs, including "helping" verbs (Is, Be, Are, etc.) except for the "to" in infinitives
Exemptions:

Only one accent color can be used per webpage.
