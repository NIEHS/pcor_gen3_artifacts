                <p><strong>Climate change is affecting not only our environment but also our health</strong>. For
                    example, increased droughts, drier soils, and record high temperatures are all environmental changes
                    that have created more severe, frequent, and intense wildfire seasons, increasing the risk of
                    adverse health outcomes ranging from eye or throat irritation to asthma episodes, heart failure, and
                    even premature death. <strong>Linking health, environmental, and exposure data is crucial</strong>
                    to better understand both the environmental health problems we are facing today and those we may
                    face in the future, so we can devise solutions and prevention strategies that will protect
                    vulnerable communities.</p>

                <p>The CHORDS project therefore aims to <strong>build and strengthen data infrastructure for
                        patient-centered outcomes research on climate change and health</strong>. We will achieve this
                    goal by providing accessible, timely, harmonized, interoperable, and linkable data on environmental
                    factors, exposures, and health outcomes. We will also provide <strong>analytical and educational
                        resources</strong> that will allow not only researchers, but also health practitioners, public
                    health officials, and communities to assess the health effects associated with climate-related
                    events, create and evaluate evidence-based interventions to protect communities, and anticipate and
                    respond to potential adverse health outcomes resulting from these events.</p>

                    <h3>What Will Be the Outcomes of the CHORDS Project?</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>A web-based catalog of resources on climate and health</strong> including data,
                            tools and educational resources, engagement opportunities, and more.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standardized, linked datasets</strong> integrating climate, environmental exposures,
                            and health outcomes. This data will follow FAIR+ principles (Findable, Accessible,
                            Interoperable, Reusable, and Computable).</li>
                        <li>A <strong>toolkit</strong> with resources and manuals to facilitate data linking and
                            analysis by different kinds of users (beginner, intermediate, advanced).</li>
                        <li>An <strong>evaluation use case for wildfires</strong> and related health effects, to
                            demonstrate the capabilities of the data catalog and its related resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Engagement opportunities</strong> to address end-user needs both on the website
                            (user forum, FAQs, Contact Us section) and at other events (such as scientific conferences,
                            Share Your Data events, and webinars).</li>
