The CHORDS project therefore aims to build and strengthen data infrastructure for patient-centered outcomes research on climate change and health. We will achieve this goal by providing accessible, timely, harmonized, interoperable, and linkable data on environmental factors, exposures, and health outcomes.

-   A **web-based catalog** of resources on climate and health including data, tools and educational resources, engagement opportunities, and more.

-   **Standardized, linked datasets** integrating climate, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. This data will follow FAIR+ principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, and Computable).

-   A **toolkit** with resources and manuals to facilitate data linking and analysis by different kinds of users (beginner, intermediate, advanced).

-   An **evaluation use case for wildfires and related health effects**, to demonstrate the capabilities of the data catalog and its related resources.

-   **Engagement opportunities** to address end-user needs both on the website (user forum, FAQs, Contact Us section) and at other events (such as scientific conferences, Share Your Data events, and webinars).
